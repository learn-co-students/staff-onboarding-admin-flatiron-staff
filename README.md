# General Onboarding - Admin

There are a couple of administrative tasks that you need to complete. All of this can be completed in less than an hour.

### Things to do on your computer

- **Finish your Zenefits paperwork.** If you haven't finished tax, payroll, and benefits onboarding on Zenefits, do it now! Ask Mike Linshi if you have any questions.

- **Use a password manager.** Password managers make your life more secure and easier. If you're not already using one, you should start. Here are some [options](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475964,00.asp); there is no company standard.

- **Set up 2-step authentication for Google Apps.** If you are not already familiar with 2-step authentication, please [read about it](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/), else you can jump right to [setup](https://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig). If you have any questions, please email/chat JM Imbrescia (Director of Engineering - Operations and Infrastructure) to introduce yourself and to get your questions answered.

- **Set up Slack (chat app).** Sign up for a staff Slack account [here](https://flatiron-staff.slack.com/signup). If you are an instructor, you should also sign up [here](http://flatiron-school.slack.com/signup) in order to chat with your students. You should definitely download the desktop app from the Mac App Store, and you can also download a mobile version as well. There is also a short guide to using Slack on our [wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Guide+to+Slack).

- **Sign up for Learn!** If you're reading this, chances are you're already signed up for Learn. However, there are many other tracks of content that you can go through to learn how to code. Introduce yourself to Adam Jonas (Managing Director of Labs) to get set up. You can work through the content on your own time, or during [Club Learn (employee coding club)](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38666277).

- **Sign up for Sherpaa (or not).** Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/sherpaa/review/113927726/8de2379e14) to get a sense of what Sherpaa is all about. If you want to sign up for Sherpaa, email Lesley Bearg (Director of Finance) to introduce yourself and get set up. 

### Things to do in real life

- **Get some swag.** Introduce yourself to Jess Parker (Campus Manager), and ask her for some swag! We have t-shirts and stickers.

- **Sign up for gym benefit (or not).** Flatiron School offers a membership to NY Health and Racquet Club. There are 9 locations in NYC, including one a few blocks away from 11 Broadway. If you'd like a membership, talk to Mike Linshi to get it set up. Flatiron School will pay NYHRC directly, so there is no reimbursement process involved.

- **Get a building access card for 11 Broadway (Tuesdays only).** Building access cars for 11 Broadway can only be obtained at the security desk in the lobby from 10:30-11:00am on Tuesdays. Get a form from Mike Linshi.
