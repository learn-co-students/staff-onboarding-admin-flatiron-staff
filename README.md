# General Onboarding - Admin
===

There are a couple of administrative tasks that you need to complete. All of this can be completed in less than an hour.

- *Set up Slack (chat app)*. Sign up for a staff Slack account [here](https://flatiron-staff.slack.com/signup). If you are an instructor, you should also sign up [here](http://flatiron-school.slack.com/signup) in order to chat with your students. You should definitely download the desktop app from the Mac App Store, and you can also download a mobile version as well. There is also a short guide to using Slack on our [wiki](https://flatiron.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OP/Guide+to+Slack).
